INSTALLATION
1. Install OS JEssie Lite on Raspberry PI
2. After installing, log in to the Raspberry PI using the default login credentials username:pi  password:raspberry
3. Connect the raspberry PI to the internet, you might have to connect it to UNL-AIR by giving chris the wlan0 mac address to register the Raspberry PI
	3.1 in the command line of the PI, run the following command 'ifconfig'  without quotations
	3.2 The Raspbery PI MAC address is listed under wlan0's HWADDR section, give that to chris so he can register the PI
	3.4 After chris registers them and they have been approved, modify the interface file to allow the PI to connect to UNL-AIR
	3.5 modify the interface file by typing 'sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces' without quotations
	3.6 Look for "allow-hotplug wlan0" under this line you should see "iface wlan0 inet manual"
	3.7 Delete any following lines after "iface wlan0 inet manual" until you reach a space between interface sections
	3.8 Change "iface wlan0 inet manual" to "iface wlan0 inet dhcp" and under than enter "wireless-essid UNL-AIR"
	3.9 press ctrl + x and press y to save changes and exit out of this file
	3.10 once back at the terminal line, enter "sudo ifdown wlan0" let it terminate and then type "sudo ifup wlan0" if all goes well you should connect the pi to UNL-AIR
4. once the PI is connected to UNL-AIR, run the following command to update the OS and depedencies "sudo apt-get -y update & sudo apt-get -y upgrade & sudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade"
5. Once the PI has finished installing all dependencies and upgrades install a couple of necesarry libraries
	5.1 run the following command "sudo apt-get -y install libssl-dev libnl-dev git rfkill iw python-pip"
6. Once that is installed use pip to install pexpect "sudo pip install pexpect"
7. Now we will begin to install aircrack from the source page
	7.1 As of writing this file, aircrack si on version 1.2 and rc4 so we can download the file by typing "wget http://download.aircrack-ng.org/aircrack-ng-1.2-rc4.tar.gz"
	7.2 once the file downloads, or if it doesnt make sure you are tryign to download the most updated version of aircrack,then unpack the file.
	7.3 It will most likely be in a tarball file so run the following fommand on the file name "tar -zxvf aircrackfilename.tar.gz"
	7.4 once that is complete, you can delete the tarball "sudo rm aircrackfilename.tar.gz"
	7.5 navigate to the new folder generated by extracting the tarbal "cd aricrackfoldername"
	7.6 in this folder we need to make the install file  so run "sudo make" or just "make"
	7.7 once the make file completes, it should tell you it does, other wise it will tell you it could not complete, run the make file "sudo make install"
	7.8 once this is comeplete you will be asked to run the oui update "sudo airodump-ng-oui-update" or simply run "airodump-ng-oui-update" whichever works.
	7.9 once that is all complete you can navigate out of the folder and delete it, aircrack-ng should be installed on the raspberry pi.
8. Now you can run the AirodumpStart script using sudo, you can modify the file to set the time interval of airodump runs. simply run "sudo python AirodumpStart.py"
